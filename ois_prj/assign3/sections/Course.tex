\subsection{Course log}
The sequence diagram in figure \ref{3img:[sequence]course_log} shows the
details of how the information system handles the procedure needed to
update the log of a course.

This process is useful in order to permit to the people who following the
course to be updated with the last topic treated, and from the other side,

\subsection{Certification}
The main aim of the course and the relative exams is to deliver the
needed certifications. The information system handles this process
