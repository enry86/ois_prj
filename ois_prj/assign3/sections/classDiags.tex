customer organization.
\item[Project: ] Here are stored all the information of the projects on
which the organization is working.

the enterprise, such as documentation, project details.
\end{description}

This section of the information system provides support for the
administrative part of AllSpark organization.
In particular it handles the employees administration, with their
specialization and roles. The activity classes permits to track a log of
each worker activity and to plan future event as meetings or deadlines.

Moreover it manages the inventory of the organization, which is mainly
composed by software and hardware (servers, network infrastructures). It
contains the references to the suppliers list, in order to retrieve
informations who supplied each item used in the organization.
