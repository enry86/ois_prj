\chapter{Business Processes}
In this chapter we analyze a set of business processes which are
fundamental activities inside our organization, we provide an analysis of
these processes and the results of a simulation.

Before going in deeper details in analyzing the processes is useful to get
a wider view on the organization structure.
AllSpark, is an enterprise with the aim to develop and deploy services in
the IT area.

Our services can vary from a common web hosting service to very complex and
possibly innovative security systems, and therefore we need to distinguish
the different departments in which our organization is divided.

\section{Departments and structure}
Our organization is divided in several activity areas, each one of them
contains the processes and the people needed to operate in a specific
field.

In our enterprise we can distinguish the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Research and Develop:} The employees in this area work actively in
the research's world, mainly in security related field. In our organization
this section is vital for improving our products and develop new one.
\end{itemize}
