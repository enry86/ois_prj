\section{Administrative Area}
The Administrative Area is the AllSpark's section interested on the management of its lifecyle. All the purposes to achieve here contribute to the Company management, and the implicit work has the primary objective of mantaining the operativity. It's important to employees direct related to these functions bearing in mind the position of the Company with respect the relations with the specific business sector.

The group of employee related in this Area are grouped in the ``Administrative'' organization nit according with the Working Structure in figure \ref{2img:working}. All processes are supervised by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who monitors the business process according with his conceptual ideas and his primary role of AllSpark's leader.

\subsection{Billing}
This process provides support for the definition of the appropriate remuneration for the service supplied.
The process takes into account the history of project development and the details defined in the contract, in order to check if they match or if some extra features have been during the development phase. The employees mainly involved are Business Consultant, Secretary and the CEO.

Image \ref{2img:billing} shows how this process is realized in practice, focusing on the resources used and the targets for each activity. The goal of this process is to provide a fair billing to the customer, balanced on the services actually delivered.\\

\subsubsection{Path Analysis}
The analysis of possible paths results five correspondence, one with the 80,40\% of probability to be performed. For simulation's convention the number of these processes per month is configured on three element on average. The result obtained coincide with the expectations.

\begin{alltt}
Probability:   80,4000\%
Execution time:  00:000:00:24:20

\subsubsection{Capacity Analysis}
The capacity analysis of the process illustrates the specified timing and costs forseen for the single activities. Morevover it exlicities the Performer associated to each activity in order to check the responsibility for each step of the Business Process. The Cycle time is as expected greater than the Execution time due to some calculus correction or, with more probability, unforseen intervent or additional features that appears during the project life.

\subsection{Bureaucracy Management}
The "Bureaucracy Management" business process aims to regulate the set of codes from which AllSpark depends on. The scope of this sequence is monitoring the country laws and the licences estabilished, check the efficiency of the responsibility charge and undertake the needed changes to restore the legality.

Since the task is actual demanding the roles it has associated are all fitting the "Administrative" organizational unit according to the Working structure in \ref{2img:working}. Particular the secretary is directed the mainly connect to all of the activities as described in the above structure.

The figure \ref{2img:bureaucracy} shows the graphical representation, focusing on the management side of the topic than the pratical step.\\

\subsubsection{Path Analysis}
Ten paths were discovered by the analysis of the modelization; the first leads with the 84,70\% probability to be performed. This result is coherent with the foreseen one since perform the ``usual'' way modeled to accomplish the task. This process is performed with minor frequency than others and so it indicates a stable company assessments that involve in updating since AllSpark aims to mantain the same structure.

\subsection{Marketing Management}
The Marketing Management business process has to promote the Company's product to the business. The campaign can be structured in several manners, with access to different media and having various targets. The primary scope of the process is to perform the best work using historical data and analyzing the results in order to improve future campaigns. Figure \ref{2img:mark_man} shows the process in its wide.

The interested performers are primary the business consultant and CEO who are supported by the secretary in the different facets of the job.

The analysis of possible paths results thre correspondence with interesting probability, one of them with the 56,70\% of probability to be performed. The analysis returns that paths have very similar time and costs and so are not so significative in hte study of this process; this means that the Company has standardize the process to be more or less as expectations.

\subsection{Public Relation Management}
The Public Relation Management aims to standardize the way how Company undertakes relations with customers, or future ones, in order to improve its  basket of possible purchasers. Basically the Manager assigned to supervise the Company's public face organize the way, the method and the information that the Representative, or the Analyst in some rare case\footnote{The analyst is not responsible to public relation, but he can be required in the project's advanced stage to fit at best the customers' demands.}, who contacts direct the cutomer, is charged to divulgate. 

The Representative has to relates with the customer in a pleasant way in order to facilitate future relationships. Image \ref{2img:mark_man} represent the process modeled.

\subsubsection{Path Analysis}
The Public Relation Management path analysis results the expected value of a high probability in contacting the customer, that is 80,40\%. The following table illustrate a huge amount of time, expecially the waiting time, but is important to evidence that is a process strongly linked to human timing such as movement in the physical world, report compilation and meetings.

The forseen costs indicate mainly the transfer expenses which are for the majority charged to the Company.

Interesting is that the relation management may happen also in through Internet and so both costs and time are very huge, but is difficult to relate with another person through the Network unless explicity required. The main objective of the Company is to reach directly the customer in the nearest places, but connecting with mail, videoconference and telephone the farest ones who may require direct high level personnel for specified tasks.

\subsubsection{Capacity Analysis}
The capacity analysis shows the time simulated with the model and the importance of that is give by the activies of which are very time spending. Apart the ``Contact customer'', the others may be overcharged since the execution time is really high. The explanation is that the center of the realation is another person and so a good comunication make easier each future relationship and so the high time is motivated by a research on the best way to relate with a third party.
