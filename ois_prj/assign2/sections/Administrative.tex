\section{Administrative Area}
The Administrative processes are performed by the gorup of employee grouped in the Admnistrative Organizational unit according to the Working Structure in figure \ref{2img:wstruct}. In particular all the processes are supervised by the CEO who is the leader of the organizational's trend.


\subsection{Billing}
This process provides support for the definition of the appropriate
remuneration for the service supplied.
The process takes into account the history of project development and the details defined in the contract, in order to check if they match or if some extra features have been during the development phase. The employees mainly involved are Business Consultant, Secretary and the CEO.

Image \ref{2img:billing} shows how this process is realized in practice, focusing on the resources used and the targets for each activity. The goal of this process is to provide a fair billing to the customer, balanced on the services actually delivered.\\

\subsection{Bureaucracy Management}
The "Bureaucracy Management" business process aims to regulate the set of codes from which AllSpark depends on. The scope of this sequence is monitoring the country laws and the licences estabilished, check the efficiency of the responsibility charge and undertake the needed changes to restore the legality.

Since the task is actual demanding the roles it has associated are all fitting the "Administrative" organizational unit according to the Working structure in \ref{sec:working_structure}. Particular the secretary is directed the mainly connect to all of the activities as described in the above structure.
