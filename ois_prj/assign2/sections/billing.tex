\paragraph{Billing}
This process provides support for the definition of the appropriate
remuneration for the service supplied.
This process takes into account the history of project development and the
details defined in the contract, in order to check if they match or if some
extra features have been during the development phase.

Image \ref{2img:billing} shows how this process is realized in practice,
focusing on the resources used and the targets for each activity.
The goal of this process is to provide a fair billing to the customer,
balanced on the services actually delivered.
