Figure \ref{img:secur} describes how a customer deals with
AlSpark in order to implement a security system in their 
enterprise.
The workflow is divided into three phases, the first regards
requirements analysis: here the customer can purchase some 
hardware devices which are needed in order to complete the
system.

Then, during the developing phase, AllSpark releases periodically
a beta version of the system, which will be tested with the customer's
support in order to fine-tune the requirements.

Finally when the system is completely operative, AllSpark install
the definitive version on the customer machines.
